Commands~

`:Pounce`                                                             *:Pounce*
    Begin an incremental search. Type the character at the destination and
    Pounce will highlight all matches on screen. Next, refine the matches by
    typing more characters (in order) that are present after the destination.
    The first letter of the match will be replaced with an uppercase "accept
    key". You can hit that key to jump to the match, or continue refining the
    search. Escape cancels the motion and leaves the cursor at its previous
    position.

`:PounceRepeat`                                                 *:PounceRepeat*
    Start a new Pounce motion with the input from the previous one.

Highlights~

    * `PounceMatch`: Characters that match the fuzzy search pattern.
    * `PounceGap`: Characters inside a match that are not part of the pattern.
    * `PounceAccept`: "Accept keys" that can be used to jump to the match.

Configuration~

  Configuration is done with the `setup` function. It's optional to call
  `setup`. Here are the defaults:

  >
  require'pounce'.setup{
    accept_keys = "JFKDLSAHGNUVRBYTMICEOXWPQZ",
    multi_window = true,
    debug = false,
  }
